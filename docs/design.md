# The architecture of the project CodonOptimizator

This tool is designed for the codon-optimization of DNA sequences, with the aim of maximising protein expression.

 The tool is composed of the following main components:

1. **Main optimization component** - Codon optimization algorithms
2. **Optimization Strategies** - Optimization modules
3. **Data** - Tables of codons and frequencies of their occurrence in producer organisms
4. **Interfaces** - CLIs file
